The first player wins if there is at least one even number and loses otherwise. 

Proof - 

If there is one even number, the first player can write it as the sum of two odd integers. 

The second player must break one of the odd numbers as the sum of an odd and an even number. 

The first player will again choose the even number. 

The final configuration of (1, 1) - two odd numbers, can only occur after the first player's move. 

----

If there are only odd numbers in the beginning, then the first player is in the situation the second player was in above and loses.
