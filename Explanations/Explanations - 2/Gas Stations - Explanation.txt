Use a simple greedy algorithm. Go as far as possible with the fuel.

    furthest_milestone_travelled = no_of_milestones;
    for(i = 1; i <= no_of_milestones; i++)
    {
        scanf("%d", &petrol_at_current_milestone);
        fuel_available = fuel_available - petrol_at_current_milestone;
        if(fuel_available < 0)
        {
            furthest_milestone_travelled = i;
            break;
        }
    }
