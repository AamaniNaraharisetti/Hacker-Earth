Charlie and Alan have challenged each other to a game of logic with coins.

The game consists of N piles of coins with each pile consisting of Ai coins. 
The game progresses as follows: in each turn a player selects any of the piles with even number of coins and removes exactly the half the coins out of that pile. 
The game ends when a player can't make a move. The last move is a winning move.

Charlie makes the first move. Assuming both players play optimally, predict who wins the game.

------------------------------------------------------------------

The number of moves on a given pile - x is equal to the number of rightmost 0s till the first 1. (Possibly 0)
The total number of moves is the number of rightmost 0s of all numbers. The parity of this number gives the winner.

int rightmost_zero_bits(int n)
{
    int rightmost_zeroes = 0;

    while(n%2 == 0)
    {
        rightmost_zeroes++;
        n = n >> 1;
    }

    return rightmost_zeroes;
}

void solve()
{
    int no_of_cards;
    scanf("%d", &no_of_cards);

    int no_of_moves = 0;
    for(int i = 1; i <= no_of_cards; i++)
    {
        int card_i;
        scanf("%d", &card_i);

        no_of_moves += rightmost_zero_bits(card_i);
    }

    printf(no_of_moves%2 == 0 ? "Alan\n" : "Charlie\n");
