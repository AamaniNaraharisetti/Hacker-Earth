2 is the only even prime number. Numbers with 2 divisors (1 and itself) are prime.

Use Sieve of Erathosthenes and then an array to keep track of sum of all primes.

    is_Prime[0] = is_Prime[1] = 0;
    for(i = 2; i*i <= SIZE; i++)
        if(is_Prime[i] == 1)
            for(multiple = 2; i*multiple <= SIZE; multiple++)
                is_Prime[i*multiple] = 0;


    sum_of_primes_till[0] = 0;
    for(i = 1; i <= SIZE; i++)
        sum_of_primes_till[i] = is_Prime[i] + sum_of_primes_till[i-1];


Then, just display the difference.

	if(left > right)
            swap(left, right);

        printf("%d\n", sum_of_primes_till[right] - sum_of_primes_till[left - 1]);

The array was too big to use an array. Using a static array worked for 98 test cases ... Using a global array worked for all of them.
