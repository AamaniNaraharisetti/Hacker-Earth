This reminded me of a Codeforces which required invoking Goldbach's conjecture (which is a theorem in the given range) and use the existence without actually finding the 
primes.

I found out what was wrong ... Goldbach conjecture is for all even numbers GREATER than 2...

So, the only time Arjit wins is when weight = 2 ... Overlooked this...

Fixed this and got AC.

    int no_of_cakes;
    scanf("%d", &no_of_cakes);

    while(no_of_cakes--)
    {
        int weight;
        scanf("%d", &weight);

        printf(weight == 2 ?  "Arjit\n": "Deepa\n");
    }

    return 0;
