I thought there was something better than the naive approach than maintaing a boolean vector of the maximum number of cities but since the number is small, it's okay.

    for(int i = 1; i <= no_of_roads; i++)
    {
        scanf("%d %d", &city_x, &city_y);
        visited[city_x] = visited[city_y] = true;
    }

    for(int i = 1; i < MAX; i++)
        if(visited[i] == true)
            no_of_cities++;

    printf("%d\n", no_of_cities);
