Couldn't solve this one ... Thought it had something to do with palindromes ... 

But, turns out this problem requires a base conversion. lol. I had thought of the idea for another problem but didn't apply it here.
Base 10 to base 9.

So, how do we convert in between two number bases ?

Take num%new base ... num = num/ new base ... Collect all the remainders and write them from right to left. 
We don't really use a string ... So multiply by 10 to move to the next position.

-------------------------------------------------

long long base_9(long long num)
{
    if(num < 9)
        return num;
    else
        return num%9 + 10*base_9(num/9);//Multiply by 10 to shift significant digits
}

int main()
{
    long long number;

    while(scanf("%lld", &number) != EOF)
    {
        printf("%lld\n", base_9(number));
    }

    return 0;
}
