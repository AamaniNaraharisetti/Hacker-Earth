There are an infinite number of primes so we'll always have a prime after the number.
We need to apply a sqrt(n) primality test on the numbers.

Note - It is allowed for distance to be 0.

    for(distance = 0; ; distance++)
    {
        if(isPrime(number + distance))
            break;
    }
